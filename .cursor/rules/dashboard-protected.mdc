# Dashboard protection (frozen)

The **dashboard** is under a protection order. It must stay exactly as it is, permanently (until the user explicitly says otherwise).

## Do NOT change

- **Dashboard overview** (`src/app/dashboard/overview/`): layout, KPIs (Total Leads, Total Locations only), or the APR Account Growth line graph (`area_stats`). Do not add or remove cards, charts, or sections.
- **Dashboard nav/entry**: redirects or default route for `/` or `/dashboard` that land on the card dashboard.
- **Sidebar/nav**: Map is hidden from nav; Dashboard, Companies, Bins remain. Do not re-add Map to the nav or change this set without the user asking.

## Allowed

- Bug fixes that preserve current behavior (e.g. fixing a crash or wrong number).
- Changes the user explicitly requests (e.g. "add X to the dashboard" or "unfreeze the dashboard").

If a task would modify dashboard layout, overview content, or nav in a way that changes what the user sees, **stop and confirm** with the user that they want to change the protected dashboard, or suggest doing the change elsewhere (e.g. a different page).
